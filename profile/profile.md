**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MahreenAyaz/tree/master/linux_sql)]: The application has been developed to collect resource usage data from the Virtual Machine and insert it into Postgres tables. This has been achieved by implementing two bash scripts. The first host_info.sh collects the system hardware specs and stores them in the host_info table. The second script, host_usage.sh, collects the system usage parameters and stores them in the host_usage table. The has been scheduled using crontab to collect the data every minute. The Postgres itself is installed in a docker container. Furthermore, the creation/start/stop functionality of the docker container has also been implemented through psql_docker.sh. Also, a ddl.sql was developed to deploy the tables. The application has been deployed using Git version control.


**BSA Fundamentals Project** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MahreenAyaz/tree/master)]: Produced a comprehensive BRD (Business Requirement Document) for Linux cluster Monitoring application. Also, involved in the elicitation and development of a user-centric stock trading application, aligning with business objectives outlined in the SRD. Utilized preferred technology stack and implemented security measures, ensuring high availability and real-time data updates.



## Highlighted Projects
**Improvement of field operations reporting at Enzen Global**: Analyzed and improved the reporting process for field operations at Enzen Global. The field workers submitted their progress status at the end of their workday. This was used to plan the activities for the next days and send reports to stakeholders. I worked to streamline these processes and ensure there were no gaps in the process. The reporting was also overhauled to make it more meaningful.
