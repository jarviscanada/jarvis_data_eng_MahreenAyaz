
This project aims to analyze retail data, uncover insights, and build predictive models to help increase revenue for LGS.

**Project Architecture**
The project architecture consists of several components:
1.  Analytics and Wrangling: This involves cleaning and preparing the retail data for analysis. Techniques such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and data visualization are employed here.
2.	Machine Learning Models: This component focuses on building predictive models to forecast future sales or customer behaviour. Techniques like regression, time series analysis, or classification can be used depending on the specific goals of the project.
3.	Web Application (LGS Web App): The web application serves as the interface for users to interact with the insights generated from the data analysis and machine learning models. It provides features such as visualizations, recommendations, and data exploration tools.
4.	Backend Services: This includes the server-side logic required to handle user requests, interact with the database, and serve the necessary data to the front end of the web application.
5.	Database: The database stores the retail data and any additional metadata required for analysis and model training. It could be a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB, depending on the specific requirements.
6.	Frontend: The frontend is the user interface of the web application, where users can interact with the data and receive insights. It includes components like charts, tables, forms, and navigation menus.
7.	Deployment: Deployment involves hosting the web application and backend services on a server or cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. It also includes setting up monitoring and logging to ensure the system runs smoothly.

**Data Analytics and Wrangling**

Jupyter Notebook - Data Analytics and Wrangling
To help LGS increase their revenue using the provided data, several strategies can be implemented:
1.	Customer Segmentation: Analyze the customer data to identify different segments based on demographics, purchase history, or behavior. This segmentation can help tailor marketing campaigns and promotions to specific customer groups, increasing the likelihood of conversion and retention.
2.	Market Basket Analysis: Analyze the transaction data to identify patterns of co-occurring products purchased together. By understanding which products are commonly bought together, LGS can optimize product placement, cross-selling strategies, and promotional offers to increase sales.
3.	Predictive Analytics: Build predictive models to forecast future sales and customer demand. By accurately predicting future sales, LGS can optimize inventory management, ensure sufficient stock levels of popular products, and avoid stockouts or overstock situations.

**Improvements**

If given more time, three improvements could be implemented for the project:

1.	Real-Time Analytics: Implement real-time data processing and analytics capabilities to provide up-to-date insights to LGS. This could involve streaming data from online transactions or integrating with point-of-sale systems to capture data in real time.

2.	Personalized Recommendations: Develop recommendation systems to provide personalized product recommendations to customers based on their purchase history, browsing behaviour, and preferences. This can enhance the customer experience and drive additional sales.


3.	A/B Testing: Implement A/B testing capabilities within the web application to experiment with different marketing strategies, product placements, or pricing strategies. By conducting controlled experiments, LGS can measure the effectiveness of various initiatives and make data-driven decisions to optimize revenue.
