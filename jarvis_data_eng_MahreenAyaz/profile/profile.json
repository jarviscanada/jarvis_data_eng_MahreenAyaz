This has been achieved by implementing two bash scripts. The first host_info.sh collects the system hardware specs and stores them in host_info table. The second script host_usage.sh collects the system usage parameters and stores them in host_usage table. The has been been scheduled using crontab to collect the data every minute. The postgres itself is installed in a docker container. Furthermore, the creation/start/stop functionality of docker container has also been implemented through psql_docker.sh.
